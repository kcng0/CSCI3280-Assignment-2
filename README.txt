The viewSynthesis.cpp implements enhanced features including full version of the algorithm and support a variable of focal length and a variable of opacity
The execution format is Arguments prompt: viewSynthesis.exe <LF_dir> <X Y Z> OR: viewSynthesis.exe <LF_dir> <X Y Z> <focal_length> <opacity>
The opacity variable(double) accepts the range from 0 to 100 input. It will adjust the amount of color level displayed in the new view image. When it equals to 100, it is same as the original image. When it is 0, the new view image will be all black.
